    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Hebba Mohmand</strong>, a third-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Virginia, pursuing a focus path in <em>CHIPS</em> — Circuit Hardware Integration for Processing and Systems.</p>

    <p>My academic and technical interests lie in <strong>electronics, circuit design, hardware-software integration, and embedded systems</strong>. Whether it’s building an audio analyzer PCB or writing low-level C code, I enjoy applying engineering principles to real-world challenges in creative and impactful ways.</p>

    <p>Outside of the classroom, I serve as the <strong>Treasurer of the Taiwanese Student Association (TSA)</strong> at UVA, where I manage financial records, streamline all budgeting processes, and collaborate with local businesses through our <strong>EasyCard initiative</strong> — a student perks program inspired by Taiwan’s original EasyCard system. I also work with national and global companies to sponsor our flagship cultural event, <strong>Night Market</strong>, in partnership with UVA Student Council, the Honor Committee, University Programs Council (UPC), and fellow student cultural organizations across Grounds.</p>

    <p>In Fall 2024, I will be joining the UVA School of Engineering as a <strong>Grader and Teaching Assistant for ECE 2600 (Electronics)</strong>, helping students develop a strong foundation in analog circuit design. I also continue to serve as an <strong>advisor for the Peer Advising Family Network (PAFN)</strong>, which supports the transition and success of first-year students in the Asian Pacific Islander South Asian American (APISAA) community at UVA.</p>

    <p>Since January 2024, I’ve also been working as a <strong>tutor with America Reads</strong>, providing academic support and literacy assistance to young students in local Charlottesville schools.  Additionally, I volunteer with <strong>NOVA RAFT</strong> (Resettling Afghan Families Together), assisting with the resettlement of Afghan refugee families in the Northern Virginia area — an experience that’s deepened my commitment to community care and cross-cultural engagement.</p>

    <p>Outside of engineering, I enjoy journaling, cooking, graphic design, video editing with Adobe Creative Cloud, exploring local hiking trails and literature, and finding creative ways to build community through storytelling and cultural programming.</p>
